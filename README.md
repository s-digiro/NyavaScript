# To Do
[ ] Analyze dead code
[ ] Add line and column to unclosed parenthesis errors in syntax checking
[ ] Replace StringErrors with actual errors where applicable
[*] Strings
    [*] Evaluate
[*] Numbers
    [*] Evaluate
[*] Rust Contexts
[*] Move Special syntax parses to rust contexts if possible
[*] Change how lists are evaluated
[*] Change how atoms are evaluated
[ ] McCarthy things need to be implemented
    [*] Car
    [*] Cons
    [*] Cdr
    [*] Equal
    [ ] Maybe more
    [*] McCarthy context??? as a type of Rust context?
    [ ] Make sure all McCarthy things are added
[ ] Lib user defined Rust Contexts
[ ] Rust context of lib that I find useful
    [ ] Like print
    [ ] Add/Subtract
    [ ] Stuff that isn't pure McCarthy
[ ] Add tests to semantic parsing
[ ] . infix operator
[*] Use actual linked lists
[*] Do not consume lists when evaluating
[ ] Garbage collector
[*] Macros?
